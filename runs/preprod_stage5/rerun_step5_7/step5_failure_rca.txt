Step 5 failure persists after minimal print fix.
Observed: rank-0 stdout prints "Current memory stack 3" (not 0).
Likely cause: three long-lived allocations from Memory2 stack on root are not released before shutdown:
- sbp allocated with Malloc at galcenter.c:260
- rbp allocated with Malloc at galcenter.c:262
- rbuffer allocated with Malloc at galcenter.c:283
No corresponding stack-pop/free call is issued for these root allocations before final CurMemStack() print.
